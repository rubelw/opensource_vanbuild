This is a repository of a draw.io image of all components needed for an electric van build.

The intent of this repository is to determine all the components, costs and weights prior to the purchase of an electric van.

This repository is currently modeled for the future Promaster Electric Vans, but more vans can be added as needed.


The design includes:
---------------------
* recirculating shower
* heated floors
* elevated bed
* flares



Current promaster estimate:
--------------------------
total cost: $23,732.60
total_weight: 1,410.0 lbs
